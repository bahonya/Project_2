Welcome to *Project 2: Neural Style Transfer*! Neural style transfer is an approach to modify a given image (the *Content Image*, usually a photo) such that it assimilates another given image (the *Style Image*, usually a painting) in terms of style. In doing that, of course we need an explicit definition of what we mean by *style*: A specific loss function is minimized which incorporates a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). A subset of layers of the CNN are used to compute a distance between the sought image (the *Generated Image*) and the *Content Image*, and between the *Generated Image* and the *Style Imgage*, respectively.

The underlying idea originates in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a> by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias Bethge. It is assumed that outputs of CNN layers indicate whether or not areas of an input image contain certain learned patterns. Each filter in a CNN layer represents one pattern, and the deeper a filter is located in the network, the more complex and abstract can be the extracted information. While layer outputs (activations) can be used directly to derive a distance between content image and generated image, something more sophisticated is needed to measure similarity in style. To establish a style based distance, correlations (inner products) between all output channels of a CNN layer are computed and stored in a *Gram Matrix*. A comparison between *Style Image* and *Generated Image* is then accomplished in terms of several Gram matrices relating to different layers. More details can be found below, in the above-mentioned paper, and in the Stud.IP Courseware.

In this project, you will use the readily trained and available CNN <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg19">VGG19</a> (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf">Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition</a> by Karen Simonyan Andrew Zisserman). In other words, our goal here is **not** to learn parameters of a neural network. We solely seek the *Generated Image*. However, you will learn fundamentals for an advanced usage of Keras and TensorFlow. To compute CNN activations and Gram matrices from inputs, you will need the <a href="https://studip.tu-braunschweig.de/plugins.php/courseware/courseware?cid=20c4897dea349b14eca5d904fda9504d&selected=1400901">Keras Functional API</a> as well as the <a href="https://studip.tu-braunschweig.de/plugins.php/courseware/courseware?cid=20c4897dea349b14eca5d904fda9504d&selected=1400902">Keras Subclassing API</a>.

1. Write a function ```load_img(path_to_img, max_dim)``` that reads and resizes an image. The function shall return a 4D-tensor ```img``` of type ```tf.float64``` with values in the range ```[0,1]```. Height and width of the image shall be scaled such that the maximum of ```img.shape[1]``` (height in pixels) and ```img.shape[2]``` (width in pixels) is exactly ```max_dim```. Moreover, the output should feature ```img.shape[0] = 1``` (batch size) and ```img.shape[3] = 3``` (number of channels). Proceed as follows:

    1.1 Use ```tf.io.read_file```, ```tf.image.decode_image``` and ```tf.image.convert_image_dtype``` (in this order), to read and convert the input image.
    
    1.2 Use ```tf.image.resize``` to scale height and width by the same factor. Make sure that the maximum

## 2.2 Using pretrained models in Keras

```tf.keras.applications``` lets you load various readily trained neural networks, for example ```VGG19``` which we are going to use here. Before starting with Neural Style Transfer, let us see how to use a pretrained model for multiclass classification.

5. Call ```tf.keras.applications.VGG19``` with arguments ```include_top = True``` and ```weights = "imagenet"```, and store the output in a variable ```vgg```.

The first-mentioned argument is to get both the preceding convolutional layers *and* the subsequent fully connected layers at the top of ```VGG19```. Vice versa, ```include_top = False``` lets you load the network without fully connected layers. The version without fully connected layers has the advantage that images of arbitrary height and width are accepted as input and can be propagated through the network (we will make use of this for Neural Style Transfer). The variant you should have loaded now accepts only ```224 x 224``` images. The latter argument ```weights = "imagenet"``` implies that a network is loaded that was pretrained on the ```imagenet``` dataset. By means of ```weights = None```, you can also get a randomly initialized version.
"""

"""vgg = tf.keras.applications.VGG19(include_top=True, weights="imagenet")"""

"""6. Use ```tf.keras.models.Model.summary``` to get an overview of the model."""

"""Each model in ```keras.applications``` has an own preprocessing function that should be applied to inputs before feeding them into the network. In case of ```VGG19```, the preprocessing function expects an image with integer pixel values between 0 and 255 as input.

7. Apply ```tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input``` to a version of ```content_image``` with accordingly scaled pixel values and store the output in ```content_image_pp```. Afterwards, use ```tf.image.resize``` to rescale ```content_image_pp``` such that you can apply ```vgg``` to the result ```content_image_rs```. Do the latter and store the output of ```vgg``` in ```predicted_probabilities```.

Above in 12. you used the *Keras Functional API* and in 14.4 the *Keras Subclassing API*. The flexibility of these APIs increases in the above order: The Sequential API is very easy to use, but only allows for models with a single input tensor, a single output tensor, and a number of sequential layers in between. The Functional API allows for multiple input and output tensors (we exploited the latter in 12.) and it is possible, for example, to build so-called skip connections where activations skip one ore more layers. The possibilities of the Subclassing API go far beyond that. Arbitrary TensorFlow functions (in our case to compute the Gram matrix in 14.4) as well as control structures like ```for``` and ```while``` can be used inside the ```call``` method. A drawback of the Subclassing API is that created models cannot be saved and loaded without extra effort. Unlike in case of the other two APIs, we need to create an instance of our (sub)class in order to get a model by means of the Subclassing API.

"""## 2.5 Adding TV regularization
Images generated with *Neural Style Transfer* often feature high frequency parts which some viewers might perceive as unpleasant or noisy. One way to mitigate this effect is adding *TV regularization* to the overall loss ```(*)```. In a nutshell, this means that large color gradients of the generated image are penalized a little bit. The resulting image usually has less local variation and appears smoother than before. Luckily, TensorFlow features a readily implemented function to compute the total variation of images and we are now going to add this function to ```train_step```.

"""29. Submit this notebook not later than December 11th.

30. Apply Neural Style Transfer to content and style images of your choice. Three (not more and not less) self-created images per group need to be submitted and are also due on Decmeber 11th.

The submitted images are intended to participate in a *Neural Art Contest* that will take place towards the end of the semester in the form of a public online poll. The guiding theme of the contest is *Nature*. So your content images should feature something from this context. Apart from using content and style images of your choice, there are several things you could try:

- Use a larger value of ```max_dim``` to produce higher-resolution images.
- Use constant or random initialization for ```image``` instead of ```content_image```.
- Use lists ```content_layers``` and ```style_layers``` that are different from the standard setting.
- Modify ```content_weight```, ```style_weight``` and ```tv_weight```.
- Replace ```tf.optimizers.Adam``` by another algorithm.
- Perform more iterations.
- Anything else that comes to your mind.

Importantly, you need to use your own code to create the images. Moreover, your submission needs to be reproducible, i.e., you are asked to submit all content, style and generated images Python scripts that can be run to reproduce your submitted images.

We recommend to use the GPU cluster, especially when you increase the image resolution.
